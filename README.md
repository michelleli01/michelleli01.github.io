# Portfolio Website
**Website Link: michelleyueli.web.app**
#### Technology: React/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

This project is a simple portfolio that I designed to store all projects I have worked on and am currently working on. Though not technically challenging, this was the first project I built from scratch using ReactJS and helped deepen my understanding of website development significantly. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of seeing something I built come to life when just a couple of weeks ago I started withh a blank page. 

#### Moving Forward
I plan on adding to my portfolio to expand into some of my hobbies such as photography. I also think it would be interesting to include a blog portion where I can get into the habit of writing more often while documenting my college experience.

#### Conclusion
This project took longer than I expected because I realized just how little I actually knew about ReactJS and JavaScript. I had no web development experience beforehand and the logic confused me at first. After learning the basics of React, JavaScript, and routing, I quickly got used to programming the barebones of the website. An unexpected challenge, however, was how tedious CSS and web design really is. I spent a majority of my time trying to make my portfolio look presentable. While not perfect, I learned a tremendous amount about web development by starting this project and I plan to add onto it in the near future. By forcing myself to think about and search for a solution to the problem at hand, I found myself learning much more than if I had simply watched tutorials on YouTube.!
